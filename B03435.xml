            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>THeſe two following Letters, written by a Gentleman to his Son at the Univerſity, came to my hand, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notice whoſe they were, then that they were the ſincere deſires of a country Gentleman, to the Heir of his Family at the Univerſity; and by ſome Circumſtances of their conveyance to me, I had ground to believe the Gentleman was of the Weſt; I was deſired to read them, and I muſt confeſs, the more I read, I was ever the better ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>You have not here any thing of gaudy language, nay, nor that gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and quaint neatneſs of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is ſo much the ſtudy of the men of this Age, who love to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear abroad in the World. And therefore you may be ſure, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had not the publiſhing of them in his view, they being dreſſed up
<pb facs="tcp:174960:4"/>by him, as the private paternal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of a Father to his Son.</p>
            <p>Nor will you find here any thing as to the Subject of what is writ but what you have very well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of by many who make it their deſign, to treat of the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth; But if you do ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider the ſincerity of the Author, you'll find in all his words a weighty Ingenuity, that will bear home deeper Convictions, of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity and moment of the Advices given; than if they were ſet off with more delicate words, they come from a country Gentleman, by whom ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Truth, in a plain Dreſs, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in a ſimple primitive Garb, is more valued, than with a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ceremonious Attire.</p>
            <p>It hath rendered theſe Letters more dear to me, that therein I find a wonderful contexture, of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt impreſſion of Religion, and an
<pb facs="tcp:174960:4"/>honourable concern, for all the points of true Gallantry; with what care and ſolicitude doth he preſs home, the ſerious minding of ſoul concerns, and of an Eternity that doth approach us all, as if that were the only thing to be minded by us, yet with ſuch vigorous endeavours of preparing for, and the managing the affairs of a preſent life, as if his Son were always to live.</p>
            <p>How truly noble is it, to ſee a Gentleman alſe warmly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to entail the Grace of God to his Poſterity, as he is to leave it the opulency of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and honor of a Family. If the Author had been a Miniſter of the Goſpel, what is writ, had paſſed as an ordinary effect of faithfulneſs, and diligence in his Employ: but being from a Gentleman, living it ſeems upon his private Fortune at home, the Words are to be the more
<pb facs="tcp:174960:5"/>regarded, and the perſon more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed. A Miniſter preacheth the Goſpel, from the Precepts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the Word of God; this Gentleman, with a ſuitable regard to the Word, and the preached Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, doth evidence the reality and life of Religion, by his own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and practice, and therefore preſſes it on his Son.</p>
            <p>That calmneſs in his temper, when he treats of matters of Religion, and of the Government of the Church, is worthy of all imitation, and gives an irrefragable demonſtration, that there may be a Presbyterian, and that in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that hath a ſuitable eſteem of worthy men, of differing Perſwaſions; and who are more concerned about the life and kernel of Religion, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the husks or ſhells, though they be the Safe-guards and Ornaments of the ſame; and though this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:174960:5"/>lived in a Country, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts a Perſwaſion; that without all queſtion, he was a ſharer in the Sufferings, that were for ſo long a time, wrapt about theſe of his Country, and perſwaſion; yet the whole of his Letters, are far from publick reſentment, or revenge.</p>
            <p>I reckon it no ſmall Glory, that as that part of the Kingdom, in a ſpecial manner, had it for their lot (and ſubmitted to it cheerfully, even thoſe of the beſt quality) to ſuffer for the Intereſts of Religion, and were eminent for faithfulneſs therein: ſo now when God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by a marvellous caſt of His own Right-hand, to give a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful change of Providences; That there are found in that Country, Gentlemen of Note, as vigorouſly to act and do in their Stations, to adorn Religion by their Practiſes, and commend it by their Precepts,
<pb facs="tcp:174960:6"/>and endeavour to tranſmit the ſame to poſterity: and it is to me a very encouraging Token, for good to this Church and Kingdom, that as God is pleaſed to raiſe up Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Church, and to grant acceſs to his moſt faithful Servants, to preach the Goſpel, ſo he is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting and ſtirring up ſome of other qualities, and employs, to preſſe home ſerious ſeeking of God, and manly Religion.</p>
            <p>If perſons of all ranks, were ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably concerned in their ſouls ſtate, and taken up with the ſtudy of a perſonal Reformation, and were i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitating this worthy Gentleman in ſuch ſerious advices, and laying ſuch ties on their Poſterity, to give themſelves unto God, as you ſee he does, the Reformation of a Church and Nation, would have greater advance, and would be a more cheerful work to the Governours
<pb facs="tcp:174960:6"/>of Church and State, then many a time they find it.</p>
            <p>I nothing doubt, when with a ſerious eye you have peruſed theſe Sheets, and how much maſſie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and religion you find, you will allow of my recommending the peruſal thereof to all, and in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner to the Youth at Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities: the Advices here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, though not at firſt deſigned for you, are very ſuitable to you, and calculat for your ſtation and age, and it may be my recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation will go the further with you, that you only know that I am,</p>

            <p>MY yielding to your Inclination, to have what I wrote as advice to my Son pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, might juſtly be repute cenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and an Action not only conceitedly fooliſh, but impudent; yea, it might be thought ſtrange, that any of my Capacity and Literature, ſhould allow, any thing written by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, be deſign'd for publick peruſal. What I did therein to my Son, was not from any ſenſe of his wanting in many books which may be eaſily had, better and more pertinent Directions tending to his temporal and eternal Well-being, then it was poſſible for me to give him; but having at ſometimes, as the Actions of others and my own have given me occaſion, obſerved what I thought to be Duty or reprehendible therein, I did conſider thereupon, and thought my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar directing thereof to him, might be to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, not becauſe of any Excellency therein, but that it being from his Father, and written to himſelf, he might be induced to the more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and profitable peruſal thereof: for I have often obſerved, that in hearing the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or having other publick Means of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every one is apt to hear or read of Duties preſſed, as if they were the concernment of their Neighbour, and not their own; which has made me much prize Miniſters diligence, in viſiting Families and Catechiſing; what being at theſe

<pb facs="tcp:174960:11"/>of their ſin, flies with all their heart to God in Jeſus Chriſt, as the only Sanctuary for Sinners: of the laſt of which, there is ſurely the leaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; the difficulty of truly coming to Chriſt, being greater then the moſt do conceive, for in doing thereof, a Sinner muſt firſt have a heart-real ſenſe and feeling of its loſt Condition, and being fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and convinced of its own unworthineſs and inability to any good in all humility, and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to throw it ſelf in the Arms of the merciful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Sinners, whoſe Blood is only able to purge from Guilt: and this every Sinner may be fully convinced of, that it can never ſeek or come to Chriſt acceptably, but as it ſees it ſelf loſt and undone, beyond all poſſibility of help without Him: and albeit our utmoſt endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form religious and moral Duties, muſt not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet muſt there be a full Conviction, that as it is poſſible for us to perform them, they avail nothing in our Acceſs to God.

Chriſt muſt be a pure Redeemer and Mediator, or Chriſt and thou will never agree: and the ſame Perſon, when preſſing to a true and cordial Believing in Chriſt, ſays to Believing, there muſt go a clear conviction of Sin, and of the Merits of the Blood of Chriſt, and of Chriſt's willingneſs to Save; upon this conſideration, only that thou art a Sinner. I ſeem herein to expreſs to you, my
<pb facs="tcp:174960:11"/>ſenſe of the need of ſomething directing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by ſome ſhort Rules to their Duty towards God, their Neighbour, and themſelves; and has ſaid, that the novelty and ſuccinctneſs of it, might induce to a peruſal thereof, in which you may juſtly tax me of Imprudence, for as the word Novelty is improper to ſuch a Subject, ſo you may alledge there is already much written, that directs to Duties, of which I am ſenſible; but they being either enlarged upon, or done in other Writings, whereby the brevity that is taking to the moſt of Readers, is wanting, and for what I have ſeen in little Rooks containing Matters of this kind, there is either apparent indifference, in directing to religious Duties, or at leaſt the want of life and zeal in principally endeavouring God's glory, as if living ſo as might gain world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repute, were moſt to be deſired. But I hear of other Pieces which are not come to my hand, particularly one done by an Engliſh Marqueſs, and another ſaid to be <hi>Argyls;</hi> and if in theſe, or in ſome others already printed, which I have not ſeen, that Want be not made up; I think there Wants not Reaſon to induce Perſons qualified; yet to give ſome brief Directions therement, for ſurely the moſt of Mankind do's generally by their Converſe declare, that the Laws of God are not the Rule of their Walk, which is much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; for if frail man could guard againſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and live according to the Rules in the Goſpel, an Society ſo conſtitute, would be to all Degrees of Perſons deſireable, almoſt beyond humane Comprehenſion. But having exceeded Bounds in this Letter to you, I ſhall only add, that I do ſincerely wiſh, there may be preſſed in

I have from my experience obſerved, that being up late at night, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bed in the morning, are a hinderance of the Duties required of us; for not only has God appointed the Night for reſt and ſleep, and the Day for Exerciſe, but you will find the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of making uſe of the Morning for your private Devotion, and that ſo early as you may have convenient and uninterrupted time for the performance thereof, before either Buſineſs or Companie may have the occaſion of tempting you to a Diverſion.

And when you ariſe, endeavour by meditation to bring your heart to ſuch a Frame, as may fit you for drawing near to God; who albeit he be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:174960:14"/>yet is the great and only God altogether unacceſſible to ſinners not coming to him, in and through Chriſt. And ſurely an Ignorant, Wandering, Unbelieving and hardned Heart has no ground to expect Acceſs to God in Chriſt our Lord. You would ſtirr up your ſelf, not only to Prayer in the morning, but to reading ſome part of the Scriptures; and I do adviſe you, when firſt you do retire your ſelf, after you have endeavoured by ſome ſuitable Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to bring up your heart to an awfull Senſe of the preſence of God, to whom you are about to dare to ſpeak, that you fall down upon your Knees, and lifting up your heart to God, in ſome few and ſuitable words, ſeek to him with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs for Grace, enabling you to read his Word aright, and ſuitably to put up your deſires in prayer, and whenever you do pray, always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your thankfulneſs, and magnifie the Name of God, for his Mercy to loſt Sinners in Jeſus Chriſt; then read a portion of Scripture, as you find convenient to ſtint your ſelf to: I think it would not be amiſs, you did every morning read a Pſalm or two, and an Chapter of the new or old Teſtaments, as you have read through the Pſalms, you would begin again and think it not too much, if you ſhould read them a thouſand times, and for the old and new Teſtament, there is no part of either ought to be omitted; but eſpecially you would read the new Teſtament and the Prophets, and for the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of the Bible, I think it not ſo neceſſary, that you do ſo often read it. After your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, endeavour to enlarge your ſelf in Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Prayer to God, and lift up your heart
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:174960:15"/>not only in a general acknowledgment of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but in particularly acknowledging him for the mercies you are ever meeting with. In your Petitions, pray for all, eſpecially theſe you have intereſt in, and ſuch as are in Authority, yea, omit not your very Enemies, and forget not to be earneſt with God in behalf of his Church and People. And certainly you cannot better at ſome times conclude your wandering and ſinful Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then in the words of that unconceivable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling Prayer of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You would endeavour duly to perform the duties of Prayer, Reading, and Meditation at the times ſet a part by you, and not to omit them, unleſs ſome ſpecial Reaſon occur obleiging you to alter, in which caſe you would redeem the loſt occaſion by a new opportunity, albeit I be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the length of Prayers, when fitneſs of frame and occaſion enables you to enlarge therein, yet I incline you ſhould for ordinar be frequent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſuccinct in that Duty, and beſides the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar times for your Divotion, Evening and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; you would not only throughout the day be frequent in ejaculatory Petitions to God, but as occaſion offers of any privacy, you would upon your Knees, with thankfulneſs of heart, humbly put up your deſires to God, for ſtrength againſt your Corruption, and a ſupply of your Souls wants, which upon little Recollection, you will always find to be many.</p>

And as it can be truly ſaid, that true Happineſs conſiſts only in an Intereſt in Chriſt, ſo one of the great Conſequents of that Happineſs, is the quiet and peaceable acquieſcing with a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

To which he again anſwered, a contented mind, with whatever in Providence is diſpenſed to me, which is indeed beyond what it is not poſſible for man to wiſh; for as the ultimat end of all the deſires, the toil and labour of man, is his reaching contentment: ſo it is apparent, the attaining what he deſires, toils and labours for, reaches not the end, and mans endeavour to do with diligence what he is called to do, and reſting contented with what Providences diſpenſes to him, is truly moſt to be deſired, in things relating to our temporal Being, and is attainable, if we would but put in exerciſe the little Reaſon we have; for diſcontent and anxiety, avails nothing to the bettering of our Condition, and doth certainly more fret and torment, <hi>Solomon</hi> in Prov. 19.3. tells you, <hi>The fooliſhneſs of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord.</hi> Yea mans wickedneſs and ſtupidity is manifeſt, in repining againſt what is done by our Creator, and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of what concerns us, for every thing, be it great or mean, is ordered by Him; as in Pſal. 113.5, 6. <hi>Who is like the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high?

Let it be what is ſuitable to perſons in your Station, and by not exceeding in the uſe thereof, free your ſelf from that too epidemick Fault of making Recreation, as if it were your Calling. Surely, it is moſt irrational, that men ſhould ſo little value precious time, as the moſt of their Thoughts ſhould be, how they ſhall cheat themſelves of what they would find to be Irrecoverable; and for which to have it redeemed from the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Folly of our vain way of living, would willingly be given, all within the power of wretched Man. Forbear ſuch Recreations as may be ſinful or offenſive: I ſhall not determine anent the lawfulneſs of Games, wherein there is Lottorie, knowing that ſome good Men have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereof; but many are of the Opinion of

Yea, I may ſay, there are not many that uſes them, without what is very ſinful; for if they be not, as the moſt are tempted to Swear and Curſe; do they not at the beſt, in the practice of that Exerciſe, evidence ſuch an intent, and ſerious diverſion of mind, as is inconſiſtent with Recreation, and diſables from Duty.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:174960:31"/>ſo I deſire it may be your care, to prevent your Guilt in either of theſe. Your motives to Duty, would be allowable in His ſight; who not only allows of, but requires our concernment in our ſelves and others, which may lawfully in a great Degree, ſtir us up to come to Him. But let your great Endeavour be, that your heart may be filled with love, to the only Living and True God, who is wonderful in Mercy, and make love to Him, the great Motive to whatever you go about: let the manner of your doing thereof, evidence your ſenſe, of God's knowing the moſt ſecret of the thoughts of your heart. It is much to be lamented, that the Duty of Prayer is ſo generally neglected; but alas! How great is the guilt of ſuch, as but ſeemingly goes about the performance thereof, in not coming aright, as in the Preſence of God? It is the heart that God ſees and requires, and how wicked are its wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings at all times, eſpecially in that Duty, as you expect to be owned of God, in Chriſt Jeſus, the day of your Appearance before His Tribunal? Strive againſt this Wickedneſs, and as an uſeful Help, through the Bleſſing of God, after you have been about the Duty by your ſelf, or joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others; meditate upon your particular Failings, in the motives to, and manner of your Performance; and hold them up to God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hateful to you, and with a full deſire, ſeek, He may ſtrengthen you againſt ſuch, in all time coming: and this without any ſeeming affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea without being noticed, even by theſe in company with you, you may do by ſerious Meditation, whatever be you Diverſion in world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Concerns; and if you do it with earneſtneſs.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:174960:32"/>you may with confidence, expect the weakning of the Corruptions of your evil heart: and as your ſubordinate ends in Duty, may be His bleſſing you, even in this Side of time, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to all Eternity; ſo let your great end in this, and whatever elſe you do, be His Glory.</p>
               <p n="37">37. My heart doth much ſerve me in repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Deſires, that ye prize the Goodneſs of God, in allowing wretched mankind, to put up their Deſires to Him in Prayer, for His Mercy therein is Incomprehenſible; yet I incline to Caution you, that your coming to Him in that Duty, may not be your Snare; for as there is but too many, that do's ſlight the doing thereof, ſo there are not wanting ſuch, who are not only hypocritical, or ſelfiſh in their Ends therein; but there are, who miſtakes the Means for the End, and think their praying, may and will atone for Immoralities in their Converſation, and are ready too much, to conſider the performance of that Duty, as the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> did, ſacrificing under the Law. We ought indeed with joy, to conſider, that our Bleſſed Lord, was once offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Sacrifice, to ſatisfie for Sin: and that we are not only allowed, but enjoyned, to apply our ſelves by Prayer, to our Merciful God, that in Him we may be accepted. But as I have ſaid to you, that without being morally honeſt, all your Endeavours to religious Duties, will be but loſt labour: ſo where one of your Ends in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not for Grace, enabling you ſo to live, you want not Reaſon to regrate your doing of it: for as the Firſt and Great Command is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind;</hi> ſo the Second

It is true, as we are required to give liberally, ſo we are to do it with diſcretion; and not only to give what is our own alanerly, but even what in our Stations, our Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being conſidered, we may ſpare; but what we do therein, we are to do it with a liberal and chearful heart. You ſhall know, that there are no ſort of Duties which God hath more expreſly commanded, than that of Bounty and Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Brethren; whence evidently the high value thereof in God's Eſteem, may be inferred: in the Old Teſtament, it is ſaid Deut. 15.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not harden thine heart, nor ſhut thine hand from thy poor brother:</hi> and in Verſ. 11. <hi>Thou ſhalt open thine hand wide unto thy Brother, unto thy Poor, and unto thy Needy, in the Land.</hi> And when <hi>Daniel</hi> would preſcribe to King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the beſt way of Amendment, and the ſureſt Means of averting God's Judgements, impendent on him; he ſays to him, Dan. 4.27. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O King, let my counſel be acceptable unto thee, break off thy ſins by righteouſneſs, and thine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities by ſhewing mercy to the Poor:</hi> this he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, as chiefly grateful to God, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifying Repentance.

And as your Charity muſt be with a full heart, extended to all in Want; ſo eſpecially to ſuch, who can be judged to have an Intereſt in our Bleſſed Lord: for in the Goſpel it is plain, the value our Saviour puts upon this Duty, by telling us in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35. That the Bleſſed of His Father, would be ſuch, as <hi>gave Him meat when he was hungry, and drink when thirſty,</hi> &amp;c. And that on the contrare, theſe doing otherwiſe, would be found to be the Curſed of God, on the left hand: and He plainly declares what is done
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:174960:34"/>to his Poor ones, to be as done to Himſelf. But mind in this, or whatever duty ye go about; that Applauſe from men, or any other ſelf-end, have no weight with you, and that all that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you to perform, is unexpreſſibly ſhort of meriting in the ſight of God.</p>

Beware of Oppreſſion, yea of the leaſt of Injuſtice to your Neighbour, in his Goods or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways, eſpecially the Poor, or ſuch as may be unable to defend themſelves, for the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Sin, is manifeſtly held forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and many are the Precepts expreſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it. The Prophet <hi>Zechar:</hi> 7: 10. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, <hi>that the Widow, the Fatherleſs, the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Poor, be not oppreſſed; and that none imagine evil againſt his Brother in his heart.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Malach.</hi> denunceth Judgments, and declareth God will be a ſwift Witneſs againſt the Sorcerers, and againſt the Adulterers, and falſe Swearers, and againſt theſe that oppreſs the Hireling in his Wages, the Widow and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, and that turn aſide the Stranger from his Right, and fear not me, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. Yea, our bleſſed and everliving God, does ſo far take the poor under his protection, as he ſays, Prov. 14.31. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the Poor, reproacheth his Maker; but he that honoureth him, bath mercy on the poor.</hi> And he is ſaid in

It is indeed a wonderful and irrefragable Evidence of the intire Corruption and Depravation of the Nature of Mankind, that we ſhould delight in evil, without any imaginable proſpect of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or Advantage to our ſelves, or others, whereof this Practice is an inſtance: And it is but too frequent, for without much noticing, it may be obſerved in almoſt all Companies, that the Faults and Infirmities of others, are oftner, and with greater pleaſure diſcourſed upon, than any thing tending to their Advantage. It is true, almoſt all Mankind, has more of what is Fooliſh and Sinful in their Carriage, than what can be ſpoken of to their Commendation.

As ye would not enter raſhly into a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried State, ſo being in it, conſider the Charge ye thereby come under, which is, indeed great, and requires the diſcharge of Duty, toward your Children, your Servants, as you are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concerned in them, and of Family-duties towards them, and all within your Family in general. I intreat the great end ye propoſe to your ſelf in Marriage may be, the having ſuch a Wife as will encourage you in the ways of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and make it your great work ſo to live with her, as your only Strife may be who ſhall excell therein.

As I have ſaid to you, one great end of your entering into that ſtate of Life, ought to be, your being encouraged in your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God-ward, in order thereto, watch over one another, and with Meekneſs and Affection hold forth to others your Failings whatever they be.

For that of Phyſick, you would be very cautious in determining your Children to that Profeſſion, for next to the Miniſtry, there is no other to which a ſuitable knowledge is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, for in other Imployments, a man by his want of Knowledge and Care, does for the moſt part only prejudge himſelf, but an unqualified Profeſſor of Phyſick, or Pharmacy, does irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably prejudge his Patient; and it is to be feared, that Ignorance and Inſobriety, which is moſt inconſiſtent with that Imployment, does but too much abound.</p>

Merchandiſe has many Snares attending it, the Devil and our corrupt Hearts combining together, where there is mulciplicity of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thereby to deſtroy our Souls; and I do truly apprehend there is no little guilt in the common and uncondemned way of dealing in that Imployment, and that both by Vender and Buyer, in their diſingenious Asking, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what they are conſcious to themſelves, is not the worth of that they deal for. And I know no Argument for it, but its being (as it is but too truly) cuſtomary: But ſo are many things very groſly ſinful. And whereas it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the impoſſibility of dealing in any Trade,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:174960:42"/>without following theſe cuſtomary Methods; the objecting is a direct ſaying, they believe not in God, and his Providence: And that he has ſaid, Prov. 10.9. <hi>He that walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely.</hi> I can for my ſelf truly ſay, I have been aſhamed to offer perſons who I was otherways bound to value as ingenuous, leſs than what they asked, being ſatisfied that the asking more than the worth, is direct Lying, and that my offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leſs than was asked, was indirectly ſaying you Ly. It is true, the Buyer and Vender may differ, in point of Judgment, and after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning may come to alter their Opinions; but it is certain, moſt uſually dealing of that kind proceeds from a covetous deſire of over-reaching their Neighbour; and it is much to be wiſhed, and were moſt deſireable, that Buying and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling were reduced to this; that the Merchant who is ſuppoſed to know the value of his Goods, would neither ask, nor take more than the true worth, albeit a Fool or Child were enquiring after them; and that the Buyer, if meeting with an ignorant and fooliſh Merchant, ſhould to his knowledge, neither offer, nor give leſs than the true avail, without reſpect to the Price ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and evite that ſin of taking the advantage of ſuch as ſells within the worth, either through folly, or through Strait and Poverty; the firſt whereof is indeed ſinful, but the laſt of taking advantage of any, under the neceſſity of ſelling their Goods, is direct Robbery of the worſt kind, being off the Poor, who are ſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods protection.</p>

I am indeed moſt ſenſible, there is no Station more honorable and deſireable than that, when conſcienciouſly diſcharged; and if it ſhall pleaſe God to bleſs you with Sons fitted for that work, and who you are ſatisfied has a Call to engage therein, conſider it to be your Credit to further the ſame. Yet I intreat you rather than deſign that for their maintenance, breed them to the meaneſt of Imployments; I do not mean by a Call, any inward thing immediatly from God, he has thought fit in the times of the Goſpel ſince the Appoſtles days, not to do ſo with men, but be fully ſatisfied of their being in ſome competent meaſure qualified for that great Charge, and that they themſelves in their hearts do truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend therein the glory of God; and not only ſatisfie your ſelf thereanent, but adviſe therein with religious and judicious Friends, and ſuch Miniſters as doth themſelves endeavour in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to diſcharge that ſo great and excellent Station.

Indeed where they are together, they are an excelling Ornament, and much to be deſired; but this Age from their Corruption, does ſo little intend God's glory in deſigning perſons for that Work, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of too many therein does ſometimes ſpeak their want of reſpect to moral Vertues, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often Conceit joyned with want of Parts and Learning, and what elſe does very much unfit them for the diſcharge of the Duties in that Station.</p>

It is not my deſign, to condeſcend too particularly in any part of my Advice to you, expecting, your own Diſcretion and Experience, will ſupply that Want: yet can I not forbear to ſay ſomething of Dancing, upon which, to have it taught to their Children, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do's ſo waſtefully imploy ſo much of Young-ones time. I ſhall not be peremptor, in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining againſt thoſe that moderatly uſe it; you will find from Hiſtory, it hath been practiſed by Great Men, who lived moral and vertuous Lives; yea, from Scripture, we find it to have been the practice of the Godly, even in their worſhipping God, to expreſs their rejoicing and thankfulneſs of heart, in that Behaviour; as in 2 Sam. 6.14. <hi>David danced before the Lord with all his might;</hi> and when God in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.13. is by His Prophet
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:174960:43"/>promiſing to His People, that He will bleſs them, ſaith, <hi>Then ſhall the Virgin rejoyce in the Dance,</hi> &amp;c. Yet, as it is now uſed, it is but little allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: I know it is generally pretended to be, only for procuring to Young-ones a ſuitable Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in the behaviour of their Bodies; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware the immoderate uſe thereof, bring them not to ſuch a Behaviour, as that they thereby, come under the Curſe pronounced, Iſa. 3.16. <hi>Moreover, the Lord ſaith, becauſe the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with ſtretched forth necks, and wanton eyes, walking, and mincing is they go, therefore will he ſmite them with a Scab,</hi> &amp;c. And albeit my Experience be inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet can I poſitively ſay, that I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Conſequences, of waſting of time in Learning, that ſo empty, fooliſh, and not truly term'd Qualification, to be fatal to the Credit, and otherways the well-being of thoſe, who ſo much practiſe it. If their Health permit, let them not lie in the Morning: and as their firſt Work ought to be their performing the Duties required of them as Chriſtians; ſo throughout the day, let them evite Idleneſs, it being the nurſery of Sin. A cheerful and free manner of Converſation, is deſirable in every perſon; yet is it altogether fitting, that Young-women have joined with it, a modeſt Reſervedneſs, for too much freedom in converſe amongſt Young-men, and Young-women, is often attended with ſtains to their Reputation, which they would, by a modeſt and gracious Converſation, greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to acquire, and retain: and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would beware of any thing, tending to too much freedom, with ſuch as are not of their

And as a modeſt reſervedneſs in their Behaviour, even in all their Converſe, is becoming their Sex; ſo a decent and becoming Gravity, is deſirable in their Attire. It were indeed an unallowable Moroſity, not to grant, that Young-women ought to have a neatneſs, anſwerable to their Quality; for it is truly decent, to behold it in young ones of that Sex; but endeavour, that the doing of it, have too much, neither of their heart, nor their time: and as all our Actions ought to have an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And if we do conſider Him as the Hearer of Prayer, and Searcher of Hearts; how daring is our Boldneſs and Wickedneſs to do it ſo unſuitably?

I remember where before I was requiring of your love to your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, even differing in the Eſſentials of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but eſpecially ſuch, as differs only anent Church-Government: I have ſaid it to be too much the practice of many, to trouble themſelves with Niceties, which Word, may ſeem to infer in me, great indifference in the contraverted Points, betwixt Presbytery and Epiſcopacy; but I did only therein mean, the later Practices and Principles of ſuch, as but too eagerly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to be the more refined part of Profeſſors; yet ſhall I ſay, I do believe there are of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Perſwaſion, ſuch as are among the beſt of Men; and that ſince Epiſcopacy was brought into the Church, there has been ſome Biſhops in all Ages; and in ſome Ages many, who were truly Pious and Worthy: but to my Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, what in this Kingdom may ſatisfie ſuch as are not able, duely to weigh the Controverſies betwixt theſe Perſwaſions, is the palpable decay, and almoſt utter-failing of Chriſtian-walk and Converſation, under Epiſcopacy. I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:174960:49"/>my ſelf able to defend Presbytery in all its Principles; and much leſs can I ſay, that all Presbyterian Miniſters, or Profeſſors, are in their Profeſſion and Practice, what is deſirable; yet is the advantage palpable upon that ſide, for Prophanity has been, I may ſay, (at leaſt in this Kingdom) the Concomitant of the other; yea to ſuch a Degree, that Swearing, and doing of almoſt every kind of Wickedneſs, were the infallible Marks of Reſpect, to that Government. This may ſeem to you, a ſevere and uncharitable Cenſure, but it was too palpable; for in their rigorous and unchriſtian Perſecution of their Brethren, of the other Perſwaſion, it was unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably evident, that the doing of what eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Prophanity, was the ready way for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.

It is above my reach, to ſet bounds to, and limite how far the Alledgeance of Subjects tyes them to Obedience; but I am fully ſatisfied, it were the intereſt of Subjects, to conſider their Tyes therein very great. There are in many places of Scripture, plain and poſitive Precepts requiring it: And ſurely a Subjects giving Paſſive Obedience, even when he thinks himſelf, or may be truly wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is what he will have moſt Peace in, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reflection; and when the great day of accompting for our Actions comes, it is more than probable, Challenges will be for refuſing, and not giving at leaſt Paſſive Obedience to the Civil Magiſtrate: And it may with ſome confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be affirmed, that many for Rebellion and Diſobedience may be rejected, but few or none for being Paſſive, will be refuſed Mercy.</p>

I have in the Sheets I wrot for your uſe, given you ſuch Directions as did occur to me, and minded you of your Engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſerve God, which I intreat may be your great work: indeed the generallitie, even of ſuch as owne themſelves to be Chriſtians, does directly in all their Walk, ſpeak forth their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of the manifeſt Truths contained in God's Word; but go not you in the broad way with the Multitude, for it undoubtedly tends to Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Our God in the Scriptures, has plainly held forth the Duty of Man; and if we could come cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially to reſolve to cloſe with him, in the Terms offered therein, we would ſee the Conditions of our Salvation, in and by Chriſt, to be neither unintelligible, nor unpracticable. In order to your ſo doing, I deſire your Diligence in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Means ye are tryſted with; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you rejoyce in your enjoyment of Sabbaths, and ſo live on theſe days, as may evidence your heart being filled with the fear of, and love to our great God, who ſet a-part the ſeventh Day for his Service; when you approach him in the publick Ordinances, have your heart intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duties ye go about, eſpecially Prayer, and Praiſe; indeed wandering of heart, whilſt we pretend to hear the Word preached, is groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinful in the ſight of God, but in prayer or Praiſe, our hearts going out after any other Object, is a direct contemning of Him, and a dreadful Mean for drawing down his everlaſting Wrath and Curſe: I adviſe you to follow my Directions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent your meditating upon what you have heard, ſo ſoon as ye can have occaſion after Sermon,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:174960:59"/>and write the ſame in ſo far as your Memorie will ſerve you, and that what ye write of that kind may be uſeful for your own reading at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times; and that I may be ſatisfied of your diligence herein when I ſee you: I deſire you buy for your ſelf, a Quair or half Quair Book, bound in a long Octavo, and write thereupon, not in time of Sermon, but after the ending thereof, the day of the Month, the Preacher's Name, the Text; and whatever you are able to remember of the Sermon, write it ſo, as it may be diſtinctly read: be diligent and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in hearing, mind the Doctrines raiſed, and and forget not the Uſes and Application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, endeavour with all your might to ſee your Sins, whereby your Condition is for ever loſt, and undone without Chriſt, and with humility of heart, depend upon God, that he may direct and ſtrengthen you to every Duty. I have been ſometimes much inclined to wonder at the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of almoſt all Men, in their whole Converſe and dealing, that does conſtantly ſin in Thought, Word, and Actions, and very often without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſonable Proſpect of the leaſt, even ſhadow of temporal Advantage; But this is the Effect of our dreadful Fall in our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which Fall, did ſo much deſtroy the Original Purity of Mankind, and fill him with an unreſiſtable Inclination to every Evil, that the wonder is, that all of us are not always committing the worſt of Evils, which that we do not, is of Gods great Mercy. I obteſt, that the conſideration of your miſerable State through Sin, and of God's wonderful Condeſcenſion in offering Mercy, in and through Chriſt, may ſtir
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:174960:59"/>you up to a Chriſtian-walk, which I humbly for Chriſts ſake, beg of God you may with all your ſtrength endeavour. I have reaſon to fear, that my corrupt wretched heart, may not in my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to you, have had the ſole proſpect of His Glory, in your eternal Well-being, and the vain Imaginations thereof, in what I do, may juſtly provoke to His keeping back His Bleſſing upon my Endeavours, to your doing of Duty; which I pray my good God in His Mercy may avert, and I earneſtly intreat, you may ſo walk, as you be not an Offence to the profeſſing the Name of Chriſt; for my Endeavours in relation to you, howbeit faint and frail, will tend to your advantage, if you ſeriouſly mind them, and ſeek of God ſtrength, enabling you to live up to Duty in your Station: and if this you do not, my heart is afraid you will thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, to leave you to your ſelf, and they will witneſs againſt you, to your eternal undoing. I did in the end of the laſt Sheets I wrot to you, ſend you the Double of ſome Apothegms and ſhort Sayings; but want of time, and the Paper I wrot upon having failed, I have herein ſent you ſome that I have found written by ſeveral Perſons: and albeit you may conſider, that your having them to read being printed, might have ſpared my Labour; yet being what of Sayings of that kind, I judged fitteſt to be under your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I have been at the pains of writing them, and of contracting ſome of them, and of altering others thereof, which makes me expect you will ſo peruſe them, as to imprint the ſame upon your Memory.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It is a never failing Rule of decerning a man
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:174960:60"/>to be in the ſtate of Grace, when he finds every thing that befalls him, draws him nearer to God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. We may ſafely expect God in His ways of Mercy, when we are in His ways of Obedience.</p>
               <p n="14">14. We do truly honour God, when we ſee nothing for us, but rather all things contrary to what we look for, than to ſhut our eyes to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior things, and to look altogether to His All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency.</p>
               <p n="15">15. In what we are called to, we ought to do our own Work, and depend upon God for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Diligence in what is required of us, and truſt in Him, is only our Duty. Let us then with cheerfulneſs perform our part, and our Merciful God will beyond all doubting, in His own due time, make the Event our advantage and comfort.</p>
               <p n="16">16. It is folly, to think that we ſhould have Phyſick and Health, both at once; God's time is the beſt time, reſolve therefore your waiting upon it: after a weary Week comes a Sabbath, and after Fight, comes Victory.</p>
               <p n="17">17. It is an evidence of true truſt, when we can wait God's time, and not make haſte.</p>

               <p n="32">32. Flatter not thy ſelf in thy Faith to God;

               <p n="33">33. If thou hope to pleaſe all, thy Hopes are vain; if thou fears to diſpleaſe ſome, thy fears are idle, the way to pleaſe thy ſelf, is not to diſpleaſe the beſt, and the way to diſpleaſe the beſt, is to pleaſe the moſt; if thou canſt faſhion thy ſelf to pleaſe all, thou ſhalt diſpleaſe Him that is all in all.</p>

If thou haſt any Buſineſs of Conſequence in agitation, let thy care be reaſonable, and ſeaſonable, continual ſtanding Bent, weakens the Bow, too haſtie drawing breaks it; put off thy Cares with thy Cloaths, ſo ſhall thy Reſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thy Labour, and ſo ſhall thy Labour ſweeten thy Reſt.</p>
               <p n="35">35. If thou deſire not to be too poor, deſire not to be too Rich, he is Rich not that poſſeſſes much, but he that covets no more; and he is not poor that enjoys little, but he that wants too much, the contented Mind wants nothing, which it hath not, the covetous mind wants not only not what it hath not, but likewiſe what it hath.</p>
               <p n="36">36. If thou deſire that uneſtimable grace of ſaving Faith, deteſt that inſatiable Vice of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Covetouſneſs: It is impoſſible a heart, (though never ſo double) ſhould lodge both: Faith poſſeſſes thee of what thou haſt not; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs diſpoſeſſes thee of what thou haſt: thou canſt not ſerve God, unleſs Mammon ſerve thee.</p>

               <p n="39">39. So uſe Proſperity, as Adverſity may not abuſe thee, if in the one Security admits no fears, in the other, Diſpair will afford no hopes; he that in Proſperity can foretell a Danger, can in Adverſity foreſee Deliverance.</p>
               <p n="40">40. If thy Faith hath no doubts, thou haſt juſt cauſe to doubt thy Faith, and if thy doubts have no hope, thou haſt juſt reaſon to fear Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; when therefore thy Doubts ſhall exerciſe thy Faith, keep thy Hopes firm to qualifie thy Doubts, ſo ſhall thy Faith be ſecured from Doubts, ſo ſhall thy Doubts be preſerved from Deſpair.</p>

               <p n="42">42: When thou prayeſt for ſpiritual Graces, let thy Prayer be abſolute; when for temporal Bleſſings, add a Clauſe of God's pleaſure in both, with Faith and Humiliation, ſo ſhalt thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly receive what thou deſireſt, or more, or better; never Prayer rightly made, was made unheard, or heard ungranted.</p>

In thy Apparrel avoid Singularity, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs and Gaudineſs, be not too early in the Faſhon, nor too late, Decencie is the half way between Affectation and Neglect; the Body is the Shell of the Soul, Apparel is the Husk of that Shell, and the Husk often tells you what the Kernel is.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Be not Cenſorious, for thou knoweſt not whom thou judgeſt; it is a more dextrous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to ſpeak well of an evil man, than evil of a good man, and ſafer for thy Judgment to be miſted by ſimple Charity, then uncharitable Wiſdom, he may tax others with Priviledge, that hath not in himſelf what others may tax.</p>

               <p>YOu may remember, that in our diſcourſing together, ſome Weeks ſince, we conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Love was the great Duty required of Man, and the Apoſtle having ſaid 1 Joh. 4.7. <hi>Let us love one another, for love is of God:</hi> yea, our Bleſſed Lord in the Evangeliſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that <hi>By this ſhall all men know, ſuch to be his Diſciples, as have love one to another.</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37, 38. That the Firſt and Great Commandment, was <hi>to love the Lord our God, with all our heart and with all our ſoul. And the ſecond was like unto this, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Let us therefore reſolve in the strength of our God, to take up and retain, ſuch an affectionat and innocent Correſpondence, as ſhall evidence our Endeavouring, to have the lively Marks of being the Diſciples of our moſt Bleſſed Saviour; which that we may do effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, we muſt caſt from us Pride, as what is deſtructive to our Chriſtian Converſe. As I am writing the word Pride, my Pen runs in adding as further, to be thrown away, Anger, Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, Revenge, or what elſe may take up in our hearts the room, that love to our God and our Neighbour ought to have; but if we could ſo take up the folly and ſin of being Proud, as to bring our ſelves to hate and forſake the ſame; we would in eviting that great Wickedneſs, which has drawn down the everlaſting Sentence of Gods Wrath, even upon Angels, eaſily maſter theſe Evils I have mentioned, and many others,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:174960:65"/>which are the proper Brood and develiſh Iſſue thereof; which Evils, being in the Strength of God weakned in us, we muſt further ſtrive for Humility, and meekneſs of Spirit; and theſe being acquired, the Vertues oppoſite to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Vices, will (through the Bleſſing of God) with great eaſineſs, become habitual unto us; yea ſo great are the advantages of true Humility, and meekneſs of Spirit, as even the worſt of Men, are from ſome ſmall Beam or Ray of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Purity, yet left in Fallen man, forc'd to acknowledge the worth thereof, and value the perſon enriched with theſe unvaluable Bleſſings.</p>

It is true, it is the Duty of every man, to concern himſelf in managing and retaining, what is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own Propriety; yet for keeping faſt that Chain of a Chriſtian and Neighbourly Converſe, it may be his Duty in ſome meaſure, to recede therefrom: and if Intereſt ſhall at any time

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:174960:66"/>the time, that Neighbours and others makes uſe of, in converſing together, is imployed. it were a ſeverity, having no allowance from Scripture, to ſay that all neighbourly and friendly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, ſhould only be about our Souls and things Heavenly; for our Lord by Himſelf and His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, do's plainly require our Concernment in our particular Callings: and ſurely, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creative Diverſion is neceſſar, to both Body and Mind; yet is it to be regrated, that ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be Chriſtians, ſhould in their ſo often meeting together, ſo ſeldom ſpeak of God, and things heavenly. Our great God, his Command to the Iſraelites was, that they ſhould ſpeak of his Precepts given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> whilſt they walked by the Way: and albeit the indiſcreet Zeal of ſome people in their meeting together, for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſpiritual Conference, may give offence, yea may be hurtful to themſelves, when their Ends are not ſerious in the ſight of God, or when there is want of Prudence, for regulating Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that kind; yet ſurely, it were delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly advantageous in Chriſtians meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they, at leaſt ſometimes by ſuitable Diſcourſe, relating to their Souls Condition, would raiſe up in themſelves a Warmneſs of Affection, towards their God in Jeſus Chriſt, and a heart-hatred to Sin, that only can ſeparate betwixt Him and them; and which would be a Mean, for putting and keeping their hearts in that Frame, as He by His Spirit, would Dwell in them; yea it were deſirable, that at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when fitneſs of Frame and Occaſion offers, that they did upon their Knees, joyntly put up their Petitions to God, and humbly acknowledge
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:174960:66"/>His unexpreſſible Goodneſs, for the particular Mercies they are ever meeting with, and never to be forgetful of the wonderful Mercy of God, in His offering to wretched and miſerable Man, Salvation in and through Chriſt. But leſt my inſiſting further ſhould make this exceed the Bounds of a Letter, I ſhall only add that I am in ſincerity.</p>

I am not much inclined to determine my ſelf, in approving or diſalowing Actions from the event, yet when ſo ſingular a Providence as has occurred amongſt us, is ſo circumſtantiat, I think in perſons of our Station, it is Duty not too nicely to canvaſs the ſame. And it may be ſaid, there are not any in thir three Kingdoms, who are not from their intereſt byaſſed, or otherwiſe from their Luſts and Paſſions induced to Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, but they are ſatisfied, our preſent King has been ſent as a Mercy to thir Lands; and that he may continue ſo to us, if our ſins do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct. It is the duty of Subjects to pray for their Governours, and that ſupream Magiſtrats may have Servants and Counſellors, that will be inſtrumental and exemplary, in the perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in thir Lands, to their living up to Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duties, and to the having the fear of God in their hearts, and rightly to worſhip him; for Princes are much to be pitied, and ſurely their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, is not to be envyed by the meaneſt of Men, for as their Cares and Anxieties are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream; ſo their Temptations to do what draws down the Curſe of God upon mankind, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten greater than frail man is able to reſiſt. And how often is the Condition of Princes much to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:174960:70"/>be lamented, from the inſufficiency and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of their Servants and Counſellors? for not only has Princes their own Frailty to wreſtle with, but are not almoſt all their Servants and Favourites their Bane and Plague, who for their own ends, counſel and perſwade to an arbitrary way of Governing; and ſurely thir Kingdoms has thir thirtie years paſt, experienced the ſad Inconveniencies, much ariſing from evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, who not only did deſtroy the intereſt of our Princes, in the affections of their Subjects, by ſcrewing up what they unreaſonably owned to be the Princes Prorogative, but by acting direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Deſtruction of the Souls of Subjects, without even the leaft ſhadow or proſpect of Gain, Honour, or Security to the Prince or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of which their Circuits were a deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtance, it being manifeſt as the Sun at Noon-tide, that they acted, as if their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had been from Hell to the Deſtruction of Souls, for granting the publick Oaths they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, might have been taken, yet it muſt be uncontravertedly granted to be the Magiſtrats Duty, to refuſe the tendering even of an law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oath, where they are ſatisfied, the Partie does not take the ſame in Knowledge and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And alas! how much to be lamented is the remembrance of the horrid cruelty to the Souls of men, that was ſo ſtrenuuſly practiſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of ſome late Circuits; for not only were publick Oaths preſſed upon poor People againſt their Light, and they forced to the taking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when it was beyond all Contradiction known to the Impoſers, that it was done manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Knowledge and Conſcience; but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

                  </gap>ed againſt thouſands, and the ſame made probable by their Oaths; where Oh! to be lamented, the extream ſeverities of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, made almoſt every one ſo to purge themſelves upon Oath, as I hope it ſhall be their Mercy to repent for it, that they may evite the Sentence of a more dreadful Judge, who is Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable to ſuch as does not by Repentance come to him, in and through Chriſt: Indeed the ſeverities in proſecuting many of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their temporal concerns; from diſſenting from the Church-government eſtabliſhed by Law, have been very hard, but not comparable to the prejudice multitudes did ſuffer from that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Contrivance, in forcing people ſo far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the Perſecutors could, to Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I can, I think in a great meaſure, free my ſelf from particular prejudice to the perſon of any, &amp; that my reſentment from any ſmal trouble I did meet with at the time, does not act me to revengeful Deſires; yet truly I cannot but often wiſh, that our Governours would ſee it their Duty, ſo to cenſure ſuch who have been moſt inſtrumental in theſe lamentable Practices, as may evidence their

My dear <hi>Theophile,</hi> we are to conſider, that whilſt our Sin be our Burden, we have no ground to expect freedom from the power thereof: I pray God may ſtrengthen us duly to examine all our ways, which if we ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly do, our Failings will be palpably obvious; and that he enable us under a due ſenſe thereof, from our hearts, to acknowledge the ſame, and with earneſtneſs to ſeek for Chriſts ſake, that we in every thing live, as minding we are in the preſence of God, to whom the thoughts of the heart are naked and open; and before whoſe Tribunal, we muſt ſtand and give an Account therefore. I am truly at this preſent, ſo full of
